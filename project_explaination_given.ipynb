    "\n",
    "* The data acquisition here can take some time. You should probably build out caching in your python scripts to store the data locally as a csv in order to speed up future data acquisition.\n",
    "* For your MVP, do the easiest thing at each stage to move forward.\n",
    "    * For example, for your mvp, decide not to deal with outliers and to simply drop all the null values\n",
    "* Model on scaled data, explore on unscaled\n",
    "* Clustering could be useful in several ways on this project:\n",
    "    * Do clusters produce an interesting insight, takeaway, or visualization that can be shared and communicated?\n",
    "    * With a small number of clusters, clusters could be one-hot encoded and used as a feature for modeling.\n",
    "    * Di!erent models can be created for di!erent clusters (while conceptually simple, this involves a much more complicated python implementation, so you should probably treat this idea as a bonus)\n",
    "* Sometimes your conclusion is that there is no e!ect or no significant di!erence. This is a valid conclusion in and of itself.\n",
    "* You might wish to start working in a notebook or to split your work up into multiple notebooks. This is totally fine and makes sense so long as eventually you clean up and transfer the work to a final notebook and/or python scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "For the avoidance of doubt, the major goal for this project is to:\n",
    "* Use clusters to help your exploration, understanding, and modeling of the data.\n",
    "* The target variable you are trying to predict is wine quality (you may decide whether you want to solve this with classification or regression)\n",
    "* If you use a cluster number as a feature, that cluster should NOT have the target variable of wine quality in it."
